# todo-app-flask-deno-typscript-mysql

This app is purely for educational/ or learning purposes. As a developer I like to play with new tech stack. 

So entering typscript in the market. I decided to learn it. Great texh stackl that you learn. Deno and its framework is worth mentioning. Also it is integrated with MySql too.

The tutorial that i followd was simple, creating an API using Deno + Oak + MySql.
I choose flask to render my html pages. New on flask though I am already familiar with Django Framework so I picked it up easily. 

It is indeed a fun project fort me where I learned so many things at once.
